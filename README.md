# Multi-Language Bitesize Projects

This repository contains small projects implemented in various programming languages. Each project is designed to explore the syntax, features, and runtime environments of the language.

## Why This Repo?

As a developer, I believe learning new languages enhances problem-solving skills and broadens technical perspectives. These projects, though simple, helped me quickly grasp key features of each language.

## How to Use

- Navigate to the folder of a specific language.
- Each project has its own `README.md` with setup instructions.

---

### **Why Combine Them?**
- **Streamlined Portfolio**: One repo avoids cluttering your GitHub profile with tiny repos.
- **Clear Purpose**: Showcases intentional learning rather than isolated projects.
- **Easier Maintenance**: Easier to update, reorganize, or extend with new projects.
